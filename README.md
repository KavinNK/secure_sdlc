## Using the Mind Map

The mind map visually represents the key phases and considerations within Secure SDLC. The central topic is "Secure SDLC" and branches out to various child nodes representing different stages like:

### 1. Requirements & Planning
### 2. Design
### 3. Implementation
### 4. Testing & Deployment
### 5. Monitoring & Maintenance

Each child node further expands into more specific details and best practices relevant to that particular phase of the SDLC.
